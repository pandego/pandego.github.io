# Project Writing Voice

## Tone and POV

- Write in first person with clear ownership (e.g., "I built", "I implemented").
- Keep the tone confident, professional, and impact-focused.
- Prioritize clarity over hype; avoid fluff and vague claims.
- Emphasize business value alongside technical detail.

## Structure

- Frontmatter includes `title` and a one-line `description` of impact.
- Use a single H1 that matches the title.
- Start with a `!!! abstract` case study summary containing Client, Industry, Role, and Impact Metrics.
- Include a concise one-paragraph overview after the abstract.
- Use sections in this order: Challenge → Solution → Key Learnings → Measurable Impact.
- Under Solution, include `→ Implementation`, `→ Solution Architecture`, and `→ Tech Stack`.
- End with the virtual coffee CTA card block.

## Formatting Conventions

- Use sentence case headings.
- Use hyphen lists for metrics and tech stack entries.
- In the abstract block, use two spaces for line breaks after Client/Industry/Role.
- Use an HTML image tag for architecture diagrams with width set to 600.
- Add a short italicized caption below the diagram.
- Use bold labels with colons in Key Learnings bullets (e.g., "**Scalability**: ...").
- Keep paragraphs short, typically 2–4 sentences.

## Metrics and Evidence

- Lead with measurable results (time reduction, latency, cost savings, adoption).
- Prefer concrete comparisons (e.g., "5 days → 0.5 day", "20 → 300 users").
- Include both operational impact and strategic outcomes.
- Avoid unquantified superlatives unless necessary.

## Technical Detail

- Name key components, frameworks, and infrastructure explicitly.
- Describe pipelines as staged flows (e.g., "ingestion → processing → modeling → serving").
- Mention privacy, security, or compliance decisions where relevant.
- Call out integration points and data sources when meaningful.
