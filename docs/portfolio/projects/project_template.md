??? tip "Portfolio Best Practices" (don't include this section in the final portfolio)
    This is a simplified example template. When creating your own portfolio:

    - Include detailed technical challenges and how you solved them
    - Add specific metrics and KPIs that demonstrate impact
    - Show code snippets of interesting implementations
    - Include architecture diagrams and system designs
    - Document your decision-making process
    - Highlight your specific contributions to the project
    - Add visuals of the final product (if possible)

!!! abstract "Case Study Summary"
    **Client**: <CLIENT OR CONFIDENTIAL>  
    **Industry**: <INDUSTRY>  
    **Role**: <YOUR ROLE>      

    **Impact Metrics**:

    - <PRIMARY KPI 1 (e.g., -90% review time)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 2 (e.g., +X% accuracy)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 3 (e.g., <3s latency)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 4 (e.g., $/€ cost savings)>
    - <ADOPTION/OPERATIONS KPI (e.g., ticket deflection)>

<ONE-SENTENCE OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT — what the client needed or aimed to achieve, who the solution helped, what it does, and why it matters.>

## The Challenge

<2–3 sentences on the before-state: pain, constraints, and stakes. Mention data sources/silos, scale, and business urgency.>

## The Solution

### → Implementation 

<2–4 sentences summarizing the solution strategy. Name the core stages (e.g., ingestion → processing → modeling → serving → evaluation), key patterns (e.g., RAG, clustering, fine-tuning), and how it integrates with existing workflows.>

### → Solution Architecture

*Short caption describing the architecture or link to a higher-resolution diagram.*

### → Tech Stack

- <CLOUD PLATFORM>  
- <DATA PLATFORM or LAKEHOUSE (if applicable)>  
- <CI-CD>  
- <CONTAINERIZATION>  
- <BACKEND FRAMEWORK>  
- <MODEL-LLM OR NLP>  
- <VECTOR DB / INDEX>  

## Key Learnings

* [Challenge]: [Solution] (4-5 pairs)
* [Show problem-solving ability]

## Measurable Impact  

* [Hard metrics with percentages]
* [Business value, not just technical metrics]
* [4-5 impact points]
