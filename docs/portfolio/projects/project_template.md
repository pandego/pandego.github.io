??? tip "Portfolio Best Practices"
    This is a simplified example template. When creating your own portfolio:

    - Include detailed technical challenges and how you solved them
    - Add specific metrics and KPIs that demonstrate impact
    - Show code snippets of interesting implementations
    - Include architecture diagrams and system designs
    - Document your decision-making process
    - Highlight your specific contributions to the project
    - Add visuals of the final product (if possible)

!!! abstract "Case Study Summary"
    **Client**: <CLIENT OR CONFIDENTIAL>  
    **Website**: <URL OR —>  
    **Industry**: <INDUSTRY>  

    **Impact Metrics**:

    - <PRIMARY KPI 1 (e.g., -90% review time)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 2 (e.g., +X% accuracy)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 3 (e.g., <3s latency)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 4 (e.g., $/€ cost savings)>
    - <ADOPTION/OPERATIONS KPI (e.g., ticket deflection)>

<ONE-SENTENCE OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT — who it helps, what it does, why it matters.>

## Challenge

<2–3 sentences on the before-state: pain, constraints, and stakes. Mention data sources/silos, scale, and business urgency.>

## Our Approach

<2–4 sentences summarizing the solution strategy. Name the core stages (e.g., ingestion → processing → modeling → serving → evaluation), key patterns (e.g., RAG, clustering, fine-tuning), and how it integrates with existing workflows.>

## Results & Impact

- <Outcome/KPI 1>  
- <Outcome/KPI 2>  
- <Outcome/KPI 3>  
- <Outcome/KPI 4>  
- <Adoption/Process improvement>
