# <PROJECT TITLE>

??? tip "Portfolio Best Practices" (don't include this section in the final portfolio)
    This is a simplified example template. When creating your own portfolio:

    - Include detailed technical challenges and how you solved them
    - Add specific metrics and KPIs that demonstrate impact
    - Show code snippets of interesting implementations
    - Include architecture diagrams and system designs
    - Document your decision-making process
    - Highlight your specific contributions to the project
    - Add visuals of the final product (if possible)

!!! abstract "Case Study Summary"
    **Client**: <CLIENT OR CONFIDENTIAL>  
    **Industry**: <INDUSTRY>  
    **Role**: <YOUR ROLE>

    **Impact Metrics**:

    - <PRIMARY KPI 1 (e.g., -90% review time)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 2 (e.g., +X% accuracy)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 3 (e.g., <2s latency)>
    - <PRIMARY KPI 4 (e.g., $/€ cost savings)>
    - <ADOPTION/OPERATIONS KPI (e.g., ticket deflection)>

<ONE-SENTENCE OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT — what the client needed, who it helped, what it delivered, and why it mattered.>

## The Challenge

<2–3 sentences on the before-state: pain, constraints, and stakes. Mention data sources, scale, and business urgency.>

## The Solution

### → Implementation

<2–4 sentences summarizing the solution strategy. Name the core stages (e.g., ingestion → processing → modeling → serving), key patterns (e.g., RAG, clustering, fine-tuning), and how it integrates with existing workflows.>

### → Solution Architecture

### → Tech Stack

- **Infrastructure**: <CLOUD, ON-PREM, OR HYBRID>
- **Data Platform**: <LAKEHOUSE, WAREHOUSE, OR STORAGE>
- **CI/CD**: <CI/CD TOOLING>
- **Containerization**: <DOCKER, K8S, OR OTHER>
- **Backend**: <API FRAMEWORK OR SERVICES>
- **Modeling**: <LLM, NLP, CV, OR ML STACK>
- **Vector Index**: <VECTOR DB OR SEARCH>

## Key Learnings

- **<Challenge>**: <How it was solved>
